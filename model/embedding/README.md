As you can see in the following image, words like 'نماینده', 'مجلس', 'دولت', 'جمهوری' are close together (in TSNE representation).
Also Vectors of country and their capitals show awesome feature of vector representation.
Other properties of vector representation (addition,subtraction) would be added later.
