**Word Embedding | Word2Vec | Glove | Persian Embedding**

Train word2Vec & Glove on Wikipedia (Farsi) with Tensorflow and Gensim.

* **word embedding**
  * Word2Vec
  * Glove

As you can see in the following image, words like 'نماینده', 'مجلس', 'دولت', 'جمهوری' are close together (in [TSNE][1] representation).
Also Vectors of countries and their capitals show another awesome feature of vector representation.
Other properties of vector representation (addition,subtraction) would be added later.
